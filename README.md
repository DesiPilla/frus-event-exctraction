# frus-event-exctraction
The project will focus on automated ‘text-as-data’ methods for the extrac- tion of discrete political (cooperative and conflictive) interactions (i.e., “who did what to whom, and  where/when”) from a large corpora of political texts. Such extracted events are commonly known as political “event data” in the literature.
