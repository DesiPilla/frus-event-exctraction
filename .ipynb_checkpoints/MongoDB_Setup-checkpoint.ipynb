It is apprehended that civilization is threatened by demoralization which would follow a general conflagration. Demonstrations made against war here last night by laboring classes; it is said to be the first instance of its kind in France. It is felt that if Germany once mobilizes no backward step will be taken. France has strong reliance on her army but it is not giving way to undue excitement. There is faith and reliance on our high ideals and purposes, so that I believe expression from our nation would have great weight in this crisis. My opinion is encouraged at reception given utterances of British Minister for Foreign Affairs. I believe that a strong plea for delay and moderation from the President of the United States would meet with the respect and approval of Europe and  urge the prompt consideration of this question. This suggestion is consistent with our plea for arbitration treaties and attitude toward world affairs generally. I would not appear officious but deem it my duty to make this expression to you.

       "  'context': 'Memorandum of Conversation, by the Officer in Charge of West, Central, and East Africa Affairs ( Feld ) [ Washington ,] February 20, 1952 . Participants: Ford Foundation—Mr. Carl B. Spaeth Mr. John Howard Mr. Howard Tolley AF —Mr. Bourgerie Mr. Feld Mr. Meier DRN —Mr. Brown NEA/P —Mr. Fisk Mrs. Sloan Messrs. Spaeth , Howard and Tolley of the Ford Foundation came to the Department on Wednesday, February 20, 1952, to discuss in general terms the Foundation’s interest in extending its overseas activities to Africa. Mr. Bourgerie began the discussion by pointing out that, due to political considerations and suspicion of American motives, it appeared unlikely that much could be done in Portuguese possessions, and perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent, in Belgian and French possessions, although in each case for slightly different reasons. Broadly the Portuguese have not favored our sending American government or private experts to Angola and Mozambique for fear of the effect of their presence on the native populations, and it was for this reason that the Portuguese were not particularly interested in technical assistance programs. The French have also been suspicious of Point 4, and although they have accepted a considerable amount of ECA assistance in their African territories, they have been extremely  reluctant to give the United States credit publicly in these territories for this assistance. The political situation in French North Africa is such that American technical assistance programs are not particularly desired. The Belgians feel they do not need American technical assistance for the Congo and have already done more than almost any other government in Africa to provide vocational training, public health facilities, etc. in the Congo. They have, however, requested ECA aid and World Bank loans . This leaves only the independent countries, namely, Libya (which has virtually no resources and needs every kind of help, public and private), Ethiopia, Liberia, the Internat’l. Zone of Tangier, where the French cannot interfere with outside efforts, and the British territories, particularly British West Africa (the Gold Coast and Nigeria) and, to a lesser extent, British Central Africa (the Rhodesias and Nyasaland), and East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika). In Ethiopia, Liberia and Libya we have Point 4 programs but there are many opportunities for further assistance from private sources. Mr. Bourgerie then specified certain general fields of activity which the Departmental officers concerned believed the Foundation should consider if it decided to extend assistance to the more promising and receptive African countries. Among these, Mr. Bourgerie mentioned vocational training, especially at the lower level, community programs for urban and rural populations, the great need for elementary and secondary schools throughout Africa, the need to support research institutions, especially in the British territories and Liberia, where research institutions exist but in most cases are completely inadequate in staff and funds to do the important work required. In response to Mr. Bourgerie ’s suggestion Mr. Spaeth then proceeded to outline the type of activities in which the Ford Foundation has been engaged in South Asia (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan) and gave some indications of the Foundation’s general policies in these areas. He stated that the Foundation was supporting in India a wide scale program of agricultural extension at the village level, a woman’s college in Pakistan, a community project for untouchables at Delhi, a project to train industrial workers in Pakistan, etc. The Foundation is also generally interested in community development work in South Asia, as well as in the Students’ Exchange Program everywhere, especially in technical and vocational fields. The Foundation is now on the point of sending a team to the Middle East to survey the countries in that area with the idea of undertaking projects similar to those in South Asia, but, looking ahead, it also wants to find out what it can do in Africa. It is convinced of the urgency of getting started in all these areas as soon as possible in view of the political and social tensions which recent events clearly indicate  have been building up against the West, and which are spreading in Africa, having already erupted in French North Africa. Mr. Spaeth mentioned in this connection that whenever the Foundation’s officials discussed programs in various parts of the world they were constantly asked, “What do you have in mind for Africa?” Mr. Spaeth also indicated the relationship of the Foundation’s activities to governmental programs, such as Point 4, MSA , etc. He stated that generally the Foundation does not normally wish to duplicate or to be too closely involved in the work already being undertaken by these programs in such areas as South Asia, the Near East and Africa; however, it judges individual projects on their merits. In certain instances in India the Foundation has provided assistance to projects in which the American and Indian Governments are also participating. Mr. Spaeth explained that although the Foundation normally does not provide funds for the purchase of capital equipment, the construction of buildings to house projects, etc., it will do so if necessary to assist in bringing worthwhile projects to fruition. He cited instances in India where the Foundation has in fact assisted by providing funds for capital expenditure. In response to a question from Mr. Howard regarding the work of the Educational Exchange Program, Mrs. Sloan outlined in considerable detail the system now in effect with regard to West African students in the United States and indicated that these students are now being carefully selected to receive a certain type of education in the United States with certain definite job requirements in mind in their home territories after they have finished their studies abroad. The jobs are usually connected with the development schemes of the countries concerned, namely, the Gold Coast, Nigeria, and, to a lesser extent, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mrs. Sloan defended the procedure of bringing West African students to the United States for advanced technical training on the grounds that the countries from which these students come are desperate for specialists and that these specialists, once trained, will be able to assist greatly in the development of technicians at a somewhat lower level when they return to their home countries. In the discussion that followed, the Departmental officers present described to the Foundation representatives the special needs and requirements of various African territories, it being generally agreed that the approach that the Foundation was taking in other areas, such as South Asia and the Near East, was a sound one for Africa as well. The Departmental officers indicated that developments in Africa were such that persons trained in vocational and in technical fields and in community development in its broader aspects could be fully utilized throughout Africa and would be in a position to make an important contribution to the development of their respective territories. However,  it was pointed out that the contribution the Foundation could make in these particular fields would probably be limited in certain of the African territories because of sensitivities involving political and other considerations. At the conclusion of the meeting it was agreed that the Department would supply the Foundation with a statement which would outline in somewhat greater detail the types of activity and the countries of Africa in which the Foundation could make the most suitable contribution. 2 A statement of the sort described here has not been found in Department of State files. <U+21A9>',\n",

I feel that three-day conf held Capetown eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth ( Deptel 191, March 3 1 ), with participation diplomatic and consular officers from Union, Salisbury and Lourenco Marques was highly constructive and threw much light on principal problems confronting this area. All participants contributed ably with candor and keen sense appreciation situation southern Africa. 2 I opened conf stressing need for perfecting plan for maximum interchange info and coordination work. I referred to importance attached to mission here as stressed in Dept discussions preliminary to my departure last Sept and that our needs for funds, personnel and  facilities cld only be appreciated in Wash on basis of our giving Dept full picture of conditions under which we are working. All participating officers ably presented problems confronting Amer interests in their respective fields and outlined manner in which others cld assist. Cols Davis and Bland portrayed scope and effects political intrusion into South Africa armed forces.

Sweeney penetratingly analyzed conflict between Afrikaner and Black African nationalism with impact on Africa south of Sahara and susceptibility resulting tensions to Commie intrusion. He elaborated need for collating info previously submitted on native problem from entire area south of Sahara through research project, assignment specially qualified roving officer on native problem within this area and policy planning staff guidance to meet potential eventualities, stressing lack contact with native and non-European leaders throughout area. Birch analyzed major aspects South Africa industrialization and limitations posed by inadequacies of water, transport, skilled labor, capital, and emphasized Union’s efforts achieve greater national self-sufficiency.  He praised consular contributions to requirements and econ reports.

Frisbie described utilization individual strategic materials in war effort and impact thereon if South Africa sources not available, and need for potential mineral survey Rhodesias and additional personnel and funds to cover extensive area assigned. Full report fols by air. 3 Part two. Fol constitutes summary conf recommendations: 1. Assignment qualified officer with [apparent garble] experience cover native affairs with special attention devoted rising nationalism throughout area south Sahara. Such officer wld coordinate present loose coverage this all-important subj. He wld have roving assignment and headquarters shld be centrally located. Preparatory such assignment Dept undertake basic research study African nationalism this area as guide. Furthermore, that policy planning staff provide field guidance this subj. 2. More adequate funds, deputy and Amer clerk be provided enable mineral’s officer discharge increased responsibilities in adjacent areas and Union in view growing importance strategic minerals these areas. 3. Assignment labor attaché and additional junior econ officers for Emb and Salisbury in view increased activity and importance to US of labor and econ fields. 4. Strengthening security Chancery premises Pretoria and Capetown, including assignment security guard detail. Security ConGen Capetown requires assignment Amer clerk. 5. Improvements to USIE physical facilities Johannesburg, Capetown and Durban and appointment librarian Capetown. Extension USIE facilities to Rhodesias. 6. Adequate courier service requires establishment courier based Johannesburg to service Union, Lourenco Marques and Salisbury plus increased service from Paris and Cairo to three trips monthly on which couriers wld proceed only to Johannesburg. Also provision for more frequent travel for Emb and Consular officers within area to supplement regular courier service. 7. Deterioration govt owned properties requires sending FBO rep to Union soonest for purposes survey and rehabilitation properties. 8. Authorizing central fiscal office Johannesburg make suballotments fiscal year basis of funds for operating expenses consular establishments. 9. Reapportionment consular districts to include all high commission territories under ConGen Johannesburg.  As Dept will see from full report of conf, sometime wld be needed adequately to analyze and evaluate wealth of info made available and to formulate suggestions based on it. Because of nature of much that was brought out in this conf, I strongly favor holding another conf within six or seven months. Breadth of discussions accentuated need expanding scope future confs to representation from all offices south Sahara. We all regretted no one from Dept able to attend and hope Dept will be represented next conf. Gallman Not printed; in it the Department approved the dates and agenda for the proposed consular conference at Capetown and suggested a few additional points for discussion at the conference.

It is apprehended that civilization is threatened by demoralization which would follow a general conflagration. Demonstrations made against war here last night by laboring classes; it is said to be the first instance of its kind in France. It is felt that if Germany once mobilizes no backward step will be taken. France has strong reliance on her army but it is not giving way to undue excitement. There is faith and reliance on our high ideals and purposes, so that I believe expression from our nation would have great weight in this crisis. My opinion is encouraged at reception given utterances of British Minister for Foreign Affairs. I believe that a strong plea for delay and moderation from the President of the United States would meet with the respect and approval of Europe and  urge the prompt consideration of this question. This suggestion is consistent with our plea for arbitration treaties and attitude toward world affairs generally. I would not appear officious but deem it my duty to make this expression to you. Herrick'"

SUBJECT Regional Conference\\\\u2014Nicosia 1 Although Governor Williams on his return will no doubt wish to report personally on the views of our ambassadors to Northern African countries expressed during the Nicosia conference, I believe that meanwhile you will find of great interest the records of that conference here attached. One is in the form of a signed memorandum from the ambassadors to Governor Williams highlighting the main points which they wished to have emphasized for the Department\\'s benefit. The other is a summary of the discussions during the conference. 2 I would like to call your attention to the following points in particular: 1. The consensus of the conference was that the AFN countries are not irrevocably committed to the Soviet bloc nor are they safely aligned with the Free World. 2. The two major motivations in the area are nationalism and the demand of the people for a better life. When a choice has to be made between what is economically rational and politically expedient, we must expect that nationalism will cause political expediency to win out every time. 3. Although all of the ambassadors applauded the criteria for economic development assistance in the new AID program, it was the general view that in this area as a whole the outlook is bleak for the states concerned to meet the self-help criteria. At the same time, AID remains vital for political reasons, and, where we have military bases, for that reason as well. 4. The maintenance of U.S. military bases in the AFN area is contrary to the tide of nationalism sweeping through those countries. Nevertheless, so far as the existing bases in the area have been given renewed strategic  importance, we must presumably face the political and economic disadvantages of holding on to them. This may require our giving further economic and military assistance, or in due course altering our agreements to make them less offensive to the nationalistic sensibilities. 5. The Bizerte crisis 3 was a major misfortune for our relations with Tunisia and may necessitate a profound revision of our policies in North Africa. The Bizerte crisis has made King Hassan II of Morocco apprehensive of our reaction in the event that Morocco has trouble with Spain. 6. While the countries concerned, many with authoritarian regimes and most with low standards of living, were admittedly highly vulnerable to Communist penetration, the consensus of the ambassadors was that the bloc had not registered significant success. The danger was an increasing one, however. The ambassadors from the countries surrounding the UAR (Sudan, Libya, and Somalia in particular) felt that Egyptian propaganda at the present time was more effective and therefore more dangerous to the West than that from the Communists. 7. There was a unanimous and strong feeling that the ambassadors were asked to make too many demarches to local foreign ministries on behalf of international issues in which the U.S. has an interest for such demarches to be effective. It was suggested that the principal effort should be made in the U.N. (for U.N. issues) rather than in foreign capitals, that fewer approaches would be more effective than the numerous approaches which have hitherto been made, that arguments should be made shorter and simpler, and that more time should be allowed between the approach to the foreign government and the crucial vote.
